# Test-GCode
This is a small program that I made to play with G codes and 
Serial Port.
It's wrote in FreePascal / Lazarus http://www.lazarus-ide.org/
You can find the windows (x86) executable. I hope in a few time, I'll upload
a linux executable. Until then you can download the code and compile into windows
It's 100% cross plataform.
